                <font color="ffffff">Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually
                refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software
                development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop
                browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has
                become ever-increasingly important.</font>
